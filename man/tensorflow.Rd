\usage{
tensorflow(os = "Mac")
}
\arguments{
\item{os}{The operating system on your computer. Options are "Mac" or "Ubuntu".
Specifying "Windows" will thrown an error because we cannot automatically install
TensorFlow on Windows at this time.}
}
\description{
\code{MLWIC2} requires an installation of tensorflow that can be used by Python.
 You need to use this before using \code{classify} or \code{train}. If this is your first time using
 this function, you should see additional documentation at https://github.com/mikeyEcology/MLWIC .
 This function will install tensorflow on Linux machines; if you are using Windows,
 you will need to install tensorflow on your own following the directions here:
 https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows. I recommend using the installation with
 Anaconda.
