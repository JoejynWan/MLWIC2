#' Setup your computer to run \code{MLWIC2}
#'
#'
#' \code{setup} installs necessary Python packages on your computer. You will
#' need to run this before running \code{classify} and \code{train}. If this is your first time using
#' this function, you should see additional documentation at https://github.com/mikeyEcology/MLWIC .
#' If you follow the link to install Anacoda and you are using a Mac, it should be in the default location.
#'
#' @param python_loc The location of python on your machine. If you are
#'  using a Macintosh, the default is the likely location.
#' @param conda_loc The location of conda. It is usually in the same folder as python
#' @param r_reticulate Logical. Do you have an environment called "r-reticulate" for which you have
#'  installed Python packages previously and want to retain these packages. Default is FALSE.
